**Below is a customer order segmentation analysis, where I analyzed confidential direct marketing dataset (226K records, 100K customers) to guide customer engagement strategies.**

**The analysis is achieved through documenting channel buying patterns by leveraging RFM ranking, heatmap analysis, and trendline plotting, as shwon in Tableau dashboards.**

Following our analysis of the broader dataset, our group chose to conduct a more in-depth analysis of Category O. While Category O only represents approximately 1% of the total dataset, we believe it is important to fully analyze category O so that one can pinpoint sources of underperformance and areas of potential improvement. We believe this to be true for several reasons, including: 


1. Category O has historically sold more to women than men. While we cannot know exactly why this is the case based purely on the data provided, we can utilize the data from Category O to potentially replicate this success in the female demographic across other categories. 

2. Category O has grown approximately at the same rate as Category E, the category with the largest number of sales in the dataset. Additionally, Category O had a very significant increase in growth in 2010, which can be examined further to determine what made that success a reality. 

3. Category O is relatively successful in terms of cross-selling products. With that being the case, we can look at those data points combined with RFM metrics to understand which customers are buying multiple products and see if that success can be amplified to grow Category O sales. This could potentially be replicated to help other category sales as well. 

 

We undertook several analyses to dive deeper into Category O. 


1. The first of these analyses was a growth analysis in which we compared the growth of Category O sales to the growth of other category sales in the dataset. What we found is that while Category O sales growth is not the best among the categories in the data set, it is middle-of-the road, showing that Category O is competitive among the categories in the dataset over the entire subject period and that the interest in the category has continually grown over time. 


2. The second analysis we undertook was a closer look at trends by year and gender. Category O sold more in quantity to females compared to males across most of the period the dataset covers. The data also suggests seasonality of the category. Most of the units were sold between October and January suggesting it could be an essential product for Winter or the festive season. 


3. The third analysis we undertook was an RFM analysis to understand which customers may be most valuable to Category O. This analysis also allowed us to understand which types of customers we may want to target based on who our current most profitable customers are. Also, we have leveraged a heatmap analysis to see where these customers are located.


4. The final analysis we undertook was a market basket analysis to understand which products customers buy, and to see which combination of items customers buy (if they purchase multiple products within Category O). 


Based on all these analyses, we have determined that Category O was worthwhile to examine, and worthwhile to further invest in and grow. There is great potential among the female customer base, and there is also great potential to cross-sell products, with an emphasis on high and medium ranking RFM customers.
